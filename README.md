# BotMan: Redefining Sumo Robotics

Introducing BotMan, a formidable sumo robot meticulously crafted for a distinguished segment within the realm of software engineering, poised to make its mark in the illustrious arena of the National Sumo Robot Championship.

Harnessing the collective acumen of software engineering disciples, we have seamlessly amalgamated our knowledge to sculpt strategies both intricate and robust, employing a harmonious blend of software finesse and hardware prowess. Our journey has been punctuated by a deep dive into the intricacies of the Arduino board, acquainting ourselves with its manifold variants.

Coding our creation in the venerable C language, meticulously tailored for the rigors of Distributed System programming, we have endeavored to imbue Bot Man with intelligence and agility.

## Key Features

Bot Man boasts two meticulously crafted paradigms:
- Front-wheel Drive System
- Rear-wheel Drive System

The rear-wheel propulsion, harnessed for optimal traction, lays the foundation of Bot Man's formidable stance, while the front-wheel counterpart, characterized by its nimble maneuverability, adds a strategic edge to its arsenal.

## Future Endeavors

Looking ahead, our ambitions soar as we set our sights on the evolution of both Bot Man and its software, propelled by an unyielding commitment to innovation and excellence.
